Commitment to Development Index
===============================

This repository is for the 2016 update to the [Center for Global Development's](http://www.cgdev.org) annual [Commitment to Development Index](http://www.cgdev.org/cdi-2015), which ranks 27 of the richest countries on policies affecting those living in poorer countries. The CDI ranks countries on seven components—aid, finance, technology, environment, trade, security, and migration—each of which has several subindicators.

The existing tool (2015) was created by [Creative Science](http://creativesci.co/). It parses data from an XML file into JavaScript objects and is built on a Backbone.js framework with help from chart.js for rendering drill-down graphs. The 2016 update will add the ability for users to adjust the weights of the seven components, which by default are weighted equally, and see the effects the adjustments have on the overall scores and rankings.

Other improvements in the works include better responsiveness for mobile and tablets, more animation, more social-sharing opportunities, and better data visualizations, perhaps abandoning the stacked bar chart for the main presentation.

The remote repo will not have 2016 data until the 2016 CDI is publicly released.
